# Interface Guidelines: Claude Framework Command Design

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive interface design principles for the Claude Configuration Framework.
These guidelines ensure consistent, intuitive, and efficient user interactions across all commands, agents, and
system responses.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness

Every interface element should be immediately understandable:

- Use descriptive command names that clearly indicate functionality
- Provide unambiguous parameter names and options
- Offer explicit feedback rather than implicit system state

### 2. Progressive Enhancement

Support users at all skill levels:

- Simple commands work with sensible defaults
- Advanced options available through clear parameters
- Expert features accessible without compromising basic usability

### 3. Predictable Patterns

Consistent behavior across the framework:

- Similar commands follow identical interaction patterns
- Error handling and recovery procedures are standardized
- Success and failure states provide predictable feedback

### 4. Cognitive Load Minimization

Reduce mental effort required for task completion:

- Group related functionality logically
- Minimize required memorization through good defaults
- Provide contextual help and guidance

## Command Interface Standards

### Command Naming Conventions

#### Primary Commands (Core Workflows)

Use action verbs that clearly describe the primary function:

```bash
/sync       # Synchronize configurations
/test       # Execute testing workflows
/commit     # Intelligent git commit process
/review     # Code quality review
/implement  # Feature implementation
/debug      # Bug investigation and resolution
```

#### Utility Commands (Supporting Functions)

Use descriptive nouns or noun-verb combinations:

```bash
/agent-audit    # Validate agent ecosystem health
/prime         # Repository analysis and preparation
/docs          # Documentation generation
/plan          # Project planning and strategy
```

#### Administrative Commands (System Management)

Use administrative terminology:

```bash
/fix-ci        # CI/CD pipeline repair
/deps          # Dependency management
/ship-it       # Production deployment
```

### Parameter Design Standards

#### Flag Conventions

- Use `--` for long-form options: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--force`
- Use `-` for single-character shortcuts: `-v`, `-f`, `-h`
- Boolean flags don't require values: `--dry-run` not `--dry-run=true`

#### Parameter Naming

- Use descriptive names: `--target-environment` not `--env`
- Separate words with hyphens: `--max-retry-count` not `--maxRetryCount`
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood: `--config` ok, `--cfg` avoid

#### Example Parameter Patterns

```bash
# Good: Clear and descriptive
/implement "User authentication system" --tests --security-audit --docs

# Good: Logical flag grouping
/test --unit --integration --coverage-report

# Good: Sensible defaults with override options
/review --scope=all --quality-threshold=90 --auto-fix
```

### Help and Documentation Integration

#### Inline Help Standards

Every command must provide:

- Brief description of primary function
- Parameter list with explanations
- Usage examples for common scenarios
- Related commands for workflow continuity

#### Help Format Template

```bash
/command-name --help

Description:
  Brief explanation of command purpose and primary use cases

Usage:
  /command-name [options] [arguments]

Options:
  --primary-option    Primary configuration option with sensible default
  --advanced-option   Advanced feature for expert users
  --help             Show this help message

Examples:
  /command-name                           # Basic usage with defaults
  /command-name --advanced-option value   # Advanced usage example

Related Commands:
  /related-command    Brief description of relationship

For detailed documentation: docs/commands/command-name.md
```

## Response and Feedback Standards

  3. /push to deploy to staging environment
```

### Error Communication

#### Error Message Structure

```text
❌ Operation failed: [Specific error description]

🔍 Root Cause:
  [Clear explanation of what went wrong]

🛠️ Resolution Steps:
  1. [Specific action to take]
  2. [Additional action if needed]
  3. [Final verification step]

💡 Prevention:
  [How to avoid this error in the future]

🆘 Need help? Try:
  /command-name --help for usage guidance
  /debug for systematic issue investigation
```

#### Error Severity Levels

**Critical Errors (❌)**

- System cannot continue operation
- Data integrity at risk
- Immediate action required

**Warnings (⚠️)**

- Operation completed with issues
- Quality below optimal standards
- Attention recommended

**Information (💡)**

- Suggestions for improvement
- Best practice recommendations
- Optional optimizations

### Clarification and User Questions

When Claude needs to ask the user a question or request clarification, it must use the `AskUserQuestion` tool rather than embedding the question in plain text responses. This ensures questions are surfaced clearly and the user can provide focused answers.

#### When to Use AskUserQuestion

- Ambiguous requests with multiple valid interpretations
- Non-routine decisions that require user input before proceeding
- Irreversible or high-impact operations needing explicit confirmation
- Missing information required to complete the task

#### When Not to Use AskUserQuestion

- Routine decisions where an assumption can be stated and work can proceed
- Questions whose answer can be inferred from context
- Situations where the General Directive applies: state the assumption and proceed

#### Example

```text
# Correct: use AskUserQuestion tool
[AskUserQuestion] Which environment should I target: staging or production?

# Incorrect: embedding the question in plain text response
I can proceed once you tell me whether to target staging or production.
```

This requirement is defined in the General Directive section of `system-configs/CLAUDE.md`.

### Audio Feedback Integration

#### Audio Cue Standards

Based on the framework's audio hook configuration:

**Operation Completion (Swish sound)**

- Successful command completion
- Agent task finishing
- Quality gate passing

**Session Events (Chord sound)**

- Framework startup/shutdown
- Major workflow transitions
- Error recovery completion

**Notifications (Aurora sound)**

- Important alerts requiring attention
- Quality threshold warnings
- System health notifications

## Agent Coordination Interface

## Accessibility and Inclusion

### Visual Accessibility

#### Color Usage Standards

- Never rely solely on color to convey information
- Use icons and text labels alongside color coding
- Provide high contrast alternatives for status indicators

#### Status Indicators

```text
Status indicators use multiple visual cues:
✅ Success (green checkmark + "Success" text)
❌ Error (red X + "Error" text)
⚠️ Warning (yellow triangle + "Warning" text)
🔄 In Progress (blue circle + "Processing" text)
```

### Cognitive Accessibility

#### Information Architecture

- Present information in logical, scannable hierarchy
- Use consistent terminology throughout interface
- Provide clear navigation and orientation cues

#### Language Clarity

- Use plain language, avoid technical jargon when possible
- Define technical terms when necessary
- Provide context for complex operations

### Motor Accessibility

#### Command Shortcuts

Provide efficient alternatives for common operations:

```bash
# Common shortcuts
/s      # Alias for /sync
/t      # Alias for /test
/c      # Alias for /commit
/r      # Alias for /review

# Tab completion for all commands and parameters
/impl<TAB> → /implement
--dry<TAB> → --dry-run
```

## Performance and Responsiveness

### Response Time Standards

#### Immediate Feedback (< 100ms)

- Command parsing and validation
- Help text display
- Basic status queries

#### Quick Operations (< 1 second)

- File synchronization
- Simple validation checks
- Agent health queries

#### Standard Operations (1-5 seconds)

- Repository analysis
- Single-agent tasks
- Quality gate validation

#### Complex Operations (5-30 seconds)

- Multi-agent coordination
- Comprehensive testing
- Full project implementation

### Loading State Management

#### Progressive Loading

For operations that take longer than 2 seconds:

1. **Immediate acknowledgment** (< 100ms)
2. **Activity indication** (animated progress)
3. **Detailed progress** (stage-by-stage updates)
4. **Completion confirmation** (results summary)

#### Cancellation Support

All long-running operations should support graceful cancellation:

```text
🔄 Processing... (Press Ctrl+C to cancel)

Operation cancelled by user
🔄 Cleaning up partial results...
✅ Cleanup completed - system state restored
```

## Error Prevention and Recovery

### Proactive Error Prevention

#### Input Validation

- Validate command syntax before execution
- Check prerequisites and dependencies
- Warn about potentially destructive operations

#### Smart Defaults

- Provide safe, reversible defaults for all operations
- Offer confirmation prompts for significant changes
- Auto-backup before destructive operations

### Error Recovery Guidance

#### Recovery Action Hierarchy

1. **Automatic Recovery**: System resolves issue without user intervention
2. **Guided Recovery**: System provides specific steps for user action
3. **Manual Recovery**: User must investigate and resolve independently

#### Recovery Message Template

```text
❌ Error: [Specific issue description]

🤖 Automatic Recovery:
  ✅ Temporary files cleaned up
  ✅ Configuration state restored
  ⏳ Retrying operation with adjusted parameters...

If automatic recovery fails:
🛠️ Manual Steps:
  1. [Specific action]
  2. [Verification step]
  3. [Retry command]

🔍 For detailed diagnosis: /debug "[error context]"
```
